               <p> It is extremely important to understand and feel the spiritual link to our<br> temporal lives, especially for the artist community because its members<br> come from the sensitive segment of society. Seeking divine help<br> and getting inspiration from those experiences and observations that enrich<br> our souls is what sets us apart from the rest of the species. A two-person<br> show titled Zikr, Volume III,which is underway at V M Art Gallery, explores<br> those particular ‘dimensions the Islamic faith’.</p>

                  <p>BY AMNA NAZIR<br>
                    In 2021, the Sindh government began demolition work along the Gujjar Nullah, with the idea being that this would pave the way for the expansion of rainwater and sewerage drains. The destruction which ensued led to the annihilation of thousands of homes. Callously declared to be ‘encroachments’, the houses which were torn down resulted in the displacement of thousands of families. Only a handful of those who were impacted by this were provided with monetary compensation, and none of the displaced families were given any alternative housing options.

                As a response NED University’s infrastructure Engineering and Development Department, the government started demolition near Gujjar Nullah in 2021 to expand the rainwater and sewerage drains as well as construct new roads. The aim was to improve and develop infrastructure in the area to positively impact the lives of those who reside there. The funding of this project was secured by World Bank, however, the houses that were recently demolished had existing leases, and the residents were responsible for paying utilities and taxes. Those impacted by demolition were not given alternative housing, and only a handful received financial compensation.

                  <p>BY NIMRA KHAN<br>
                    Rasheed Araeen, a London-based Pakistani artist, who is one of the pioneers of Minimalism in the UK. However, he found it difficult to be recognized in the mainstream Modernist discourse, because of the conservatism of the art establishment. He became one of the critical voices fighting to create a space for himself and others like him through the written word, rewriting art history from an alternate perspective. His book, “Islam and Modernism”, is the latest in this quest, a result of his attempts to reconcile the Modern in his work with the Islamic, which he has only recently accepted and appreciated.
